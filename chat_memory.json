In ancient India, toilets were simple holes in the ground or seats over pits, dating back to around 2500 BCE in the Indus Valley Civilization.\n\nIn ancient Rome, toilets were more advanced and often found in public bathhouses. The Romans developed a system of sewers and public toilets, known as latrinae, which were typically benches with holes over drains. The waste was often discharged into the Tiber River or other waterways.\n\nIt's worth noting that the initial statement about ancient Romans reusing their own urine and feces seems to be an exaggeration or inaccuracy. The sources provided suggest that ancient Romans used public toilets and had a system of sewers to dispose of waste, rather than reusing it.\n\nAdditionally, the Reddit comment clarifies that while the Romans did have sewers, they lacked u-bends, which limited their functionality."
